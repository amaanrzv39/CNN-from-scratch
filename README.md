# CNN Implementation from Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, without relying on deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to understand and implement the core components of a CNN, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and training using only basic Python and NumPy.

## Features

- Manual Implementation: No external deep learning libraries used. Only Python and NumPy are leveraged.
- Core Components:
    Convolutional layers
    Max-pooling layers
    Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.)
    Fully connected layers
    Loss computation
    Backpropagation: Implemented from scratch for parameter updates using gradient descent.
    Flexible Architecture: Easily extendable to support various architectures.
    Basic Dataset Support: Tested with simple datasets like MNIST or custom datasets.
